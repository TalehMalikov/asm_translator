# Hack Assembler – Project 6 (Nand2Tetris)
A Python-based Hack Assembler that converts Hack Assembly (`.asm`) into Hack Machine Code (`.hack`), built as part of the Nand2Tetris course (Project 6).

## How It Works

The assembler follows a two-pass approach:

1. **First Pass** — scans all commands without writing output. Records every label `(LABEL)` into the symbol table with its corresponding ROM address. Labels themselves do not occupy ROM space and are not counted as instructions.

2. **Second Pass** — translates each command into 16-bit binary and writes to the `.hack` output file:
   - **A-instructions** (`@value`) → 16-bit binary starting with `0`
   - **C-instructions** (`dest=comp;jump`) → 16-bit binary starting with `111`
   - Variables encountered for the first time are assigned RAM addresses starting from 16.

The `ASMTranslator` class ties the `Parser`, `CodeWriter`, and `Translations` together and drives the full process.

## Usage

Run the assembler from the project root:
```bash
python main.py
```

Edit `main.py` to choose which `.asm` files to assemble:
```python
test_files = [
    'data/add/Add.asm',
    'data/max/Max.asm',
    # add more as needed
]
```

Each `.asm` file will produce a corresponding `.hack` file in the same directory.

---

## Testing

We can compare generated `.hack` files against the expected `.hack` files generated by the **Assembler** from the Nand2Tetris software suite. They should be identical line by line.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
